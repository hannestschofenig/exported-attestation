Can you refer me to the document which is closest in the sense it is used?\n- I don't seem to understand the following sentence: \n> The end-entity certificate is associated with key material that serves as an Attestation Key, which acts as Evidence originating from the Attester.\n- Not sure about the following sentence: Why not from the client? Are you scoping to a specific scenario, e.g., server/client as Attester or something else? This needs some explanation. \n> The mechanisms described in this document focus primarily on the server's ability to generate TLS Exported Authenticators.",

It depends on the order of data flow. \r\n> These interactions can follow different models, such as the passport or background check model, depending on the role of a verifier in the system.\r\n- The text regarding RFC 9261 in the draft was very confusing to me. Particularly, we need to distinguish between Exported Authenticator and Authenticator Request. I made some initial changes. Please check. ",
